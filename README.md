Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jasper KrockÃ©, a second-year Informatica student at Hogeschool Rotterdam in the Netherlands.

# Job inquiries

For job inquiries, don't hesitate to contact me at j.krocke@outlook.com.     
I'm always looking for more experience in the field of Computer Graphics!    
I'm currently only looking for internships in or nearby the Netherlands.

# Personal Projects

I'm currently developing a game engine, called Rhodium, written primarily in Lua and GLSL, built on the LÃ–VE framework.    
From time to time i work on smaller side projects as well, like my (barebones) Vulkan renderer in C++ and Software raytracer.
