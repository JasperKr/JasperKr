Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jasper KrockÃ©, a second-year student at Hogeschool Rotterdam in the Netherlands.

I'm developing a game engine, Rhodium (name WIP), written primarily in Lua with some C, built on the LÃ–VE framework.

Feel free to reach out to me at `j.krocke@outlook.com` or on Discord at `jaspersgames`.
