Hi there! 👋

I'm Jasper Krocké, a third-year Informatica student at Hogeschool Rotterdam in the Netherlands.

# Personal Projects

I've spent the last 4 years developing a game engine, called Rhodium, written in Lua and GLSL, built on the LÖVE framework.
And I'm currently developing a new game engine written in C++, Lua and Slang. Built with Vulkan and SDL3.

If you want you can check out my portfolio at https://jasperkr.github.io/ :)
